      "description": "Anchornaut is a full-stack project that empowers you to turn your wildest dreams into achievable and concrete personal projects. The platform leverages the <strong>OpenAI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) </strong> chat API to create a dynamic system where users can input their dreams, and the AI generates tasks and subtasks to help bring those dreams to life.<br/><br/>The project includes both a backend and a front-end component. Anchornaut utilizes <mark style='background-color:#D1D8CE'>MongoDB as its database, Node.js and Express.js on the server-side to provide a solid foundation. Security is reinforced with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for authentication</mark>. Integration with OpenAI enables task generation based on user input.<br/><br/>On the frontend, React is the primary library for interface construction, with React Router Dom and React hooks for routing and state management. HTTP requests are efficiently handled with Axios. For more details, check out the GitHub repository.</br></br><mark style='background-color:#D1D8CE'>Important note¬†‚ö†Ô∏è</mark></br></br>I had very little experience with React and limited time to develop the project when I did it. (We had about a week to do everything.) So, I need to be honest and admit that there are several mistakes in this project, along with areas for improvement that I would like (and will) work on to refine my work.</br></br>Here's a list of them:</br></br>Errors:</br></br><strong>1.</strong>The code is repetitive and verbose. I definitely wasn't a Clean Code enthusiast here, and I'm trying to improve on smaller projects I've taken on since then.</br></br><strong>2.</strong>For some reason (that only past Marcela understands), some classes are nameless, with styling code directly in the component. Changing this is in my plans.</br></br><strong>3.</strong>There are authentication issues for users that persist in the deployment. I'm still struggling to figure out how to solve them.</br></br>Beyond the errors, I need to say that given the time I had, the bold idea, and the knowledge at that time, it was a miracle to deliver the project. I'm studying and improving to fix the errors and be proud of the code behind this project with such a cool idea. üöÄ",
