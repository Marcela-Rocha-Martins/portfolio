# My Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! As a frontend web developer, I embarked on this journey to create a creative and visually appealing representation of my skills, projects, and experiences. The inspiration for this portfolio came from mimicking popular operating systems like Mac, LinkedIn, and email.

## Project Details

### Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**

### Design Collaboration

I leveraged Figma to streamline communication between design and styling during the development process. The initial design concept was conceptualized by my husband and I.

### Special Features

One of the features of the portfolio is the window dragging functionality, which enhances the user experience. This was implemented using the React package called Draggable, providing a smooth and intuitive interface.

## Current Status

While the initial version is live, there are still areas that need tweaking and improvements. I am actively working on enhancing the overall user experience and adding new features to showcase my evolving skill set.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

Feel free to explore the project, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
